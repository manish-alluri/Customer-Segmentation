<h2>Customer Segmentation on E-Commerce Dataset </h2>

This  project  aims  to  segment customers  based  on  their  spending  patterns and  identify  the  most  valuable  segments  to the  business  so  that  e-commerce  companies can  target  them  with  different  marketing strategies  to  generate  revenue.  This  project helps  e-commerce  companies  to  spend  their marketing  budget efficiently  to  maximize profit  for  the  company.  This  project  solves this  with  unsupervised  machine  learning techniques  such  as  Clustering,  RFM Analysis, Cohort Analysis.

With  market  basket  analysis  combined  to this,  an  e-commerce  company  can  have  all the  information  to  make  strategies  to increase  their  sales.  We  could  achieve  even better  results  by  refining  the  description column  using  nlp  techniques  to  categorize the  products  K-means  was  the  only clustering  model  used  in  RFM  analysis. More  clustering  models  could  improve  the results.
